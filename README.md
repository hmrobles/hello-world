# hello-world
Initial Repo

I finally decided to contribute to my Git. I am very behind and have quite a good amount of projects to upload on here
as a portfolio. My name is Hector and I am a recent graduate in Electrical Engineering and am pursuing a Master's of Science in Data Science. I am very excited to get involved with the Machine Learning community.
